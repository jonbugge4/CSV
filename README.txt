This project contains 5 total working files (Sitka1, Sitka2, 
Sitka3, Sitka4, and Death_Sitka). All of theses working files
are designed to use CSV files (also attached in the repository)
for data points. This data allows us to find column names and 
practice grabbing desired data. 

Further, we praciticed plotting data in a pracitcal manner 
using plotly. Death_Sitka Uses two of the CSV files and plotly
to create two graphs showing us the annual temperatutes of
Sitka, Alaska and Death Valley, Arizona.

This project was designed to introduce working with CSV files
and working with lists from external files. Each Sitka file 
is progressively more complicated adn allows for concept 
mastery through building experience working with the files, 
lists, and tools.
